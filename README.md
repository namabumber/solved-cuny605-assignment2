 <li>Show that <em>A<sup>T</sup></em> <em>A</em> 6= <em>AA<sup>T</sup></em> in genera (Proof and demonstration.)</li>

 <li>For a special type of square matrix <em>A</em>, we get <em>A<sup>T</sup></em> <em>A</em> = <em>AA<sup>T</sup></em> . Under what conditions could this be true? (Hint: The Identity matrix <em>I </em>is an example of such a matrix).</li>

 <li>Problem set 2</li>

</ol>

Matrix factorization is a very important problem. There are supercomputers built just to do matrix factorizations. Every second you are on an airplane, matrices are being factorized. Radars that track flights use a technique called Kalman filtering. At the heart of Kalman Filtering is a Matrix Factorization operation. Kalman Filters are solving linear systems of equations when they track your flight using radars.

Write an R function to factorize a square matrix A into LU or LDU, whichever you prefer. Please submit your response in an R Markdown document using our class naming convention, E.g. LFulton_As<u>s</u>ignment2_PS2.png

You don’t have to worry about permuting rows of A and you can assume that A is less than 5×5, if you need to hard-code any variables in your code. If you doing the entire assignment in R, then please submit only one markdown document for both the problems.
